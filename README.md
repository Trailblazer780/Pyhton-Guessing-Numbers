# PROG 1700 (Introduction to Programming) Project 2
## Guessing Numbers

This program will pick a randomly generated number between 1 and 100 and the user will have 10 tries to guess the number.
If the user guesses a number that is lower than the random number then it will tell the user to guess higher, if the user
guesses a number that is higher than the random number it will tell the user to guess lower. If the user guesses the correct number
the program will tell the user than the game has been won and the program will restart with a differnt random number selected.

## How to use:
1. Enter in an integer guess between 1 and 100.
2. Guess higher or lower depending on the hints given by the program.
3. If the correct number is guessed the program will tell the user has won - you only get 10 guesses!
